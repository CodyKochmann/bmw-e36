# BMW E36
Hi, this is where I keep all my [notes](), [changes](https://github.com/CodyKochmann/bmw-e36/blob/master/changelog.md), [struggles](https://github.com/CodyKochmann/bmw-e36/blob/master/issues.md) and [future plans](https://github.com/CodyKochmann/bmw-e36/blob/master/todo.md) for my BMW E36. Feel free to contact me if you need help on  a similar project or have some knowledge you can contribute to this build. :)

### How can you contribute?

> If you want to help, you can start by [opening an issue](https://github.com/CodyKochmann/bmw-e36/issues) which (in forum terms) starts a new thread/discussion under this project. I'm open to all tips/suggestions/criticisms or anything else you can come up with, as long as it's reasonable. Do note though: Dropping a few thousand for an engine swap is not within reason unless the entire process can be done for less than the original $500 that I spent on the E36.

### How did this get started? 

> I'm an engineer, I like to build things strong. When I finally realized how utterly boring it was to give the amount of engineering effort I was giving to a Ford Focus, I decided it was time that I moved onto a car with a huge community that I can actually enjoy. So, after a few weeks watching craigslist, I found a 1995 BMW E36 325iS for $500 and knew I found what I was looking for.

### What are my plans for this car?

> I plan on driving this car both as a daily driver and in rallies. While most are interested in making a car as fast and powerful as possible, I'm more interested in building an ironclad that can withstand a beating in rally and still be comfortable to drive day to day without the whole project costing me a fortune.
